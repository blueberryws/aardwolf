Made with Squarespace.
"hero" is:
- two heading texts
- two images, one is a gallery on a timer
- little explanation text, and a button
- kinda-sorta responsive
front page has very-cohesive use of color
uses "square" for booking form
has a "square" shop
has map integration
"Proliferation of pages" - Maybe for SEO?
Got the weird "lazy load" of the page. I hate this.
Uses both serif and sans-serif fonts.
 - I think there is potential here. But it was fairly poorly executed
 site seems pretty focused, and the calls to action are pretty good

 Features:
 - mailing-list signup
 - square shop and booking links
 - socials
 - hero
 - about
 - testimonials
 - products about
 - book appointment
 - shop link
 - "subpages" for each treatment type
 - policies page
 - faqs page
