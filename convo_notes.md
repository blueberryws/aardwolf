- "style set" and "information tag" are separate notions.
- We're going to use SASS "extends" for the style-set, and the information-tag will indiciate the piece of content's place in the heirarchy.

- Testmonial Text is it's own thing named "testimonial-text" (as opposed to p2 or "alternate-text" or "small-text")
- There is more work to be done to figure out how to name things:
  - Style-based names
  - information architecture names
  - heirarchy names
